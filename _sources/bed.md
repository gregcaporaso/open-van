# Bed

This page has a few photos that show how the bed is mounted.

The basic idea is that I installed [cross nuts](https://faroutride.com/crossnut/) along both walls of the van. I then cut some 2"x6"s to size, sanded them, and bolted them into the cross nuts. Then I attached [joist hangers](https://amzn.to/3vC6IjO) to the 2"x6"s, and added joists running across the width of the van. Finally, I cut some pre-finished 3/4" plywood to size, and attached that to the top of the joists to create the platform for the bed. Seems to be working well so far!

In {numref}`joist-1` you can see that I initially tried to attach bungee netting to the underside of the bed to use the joist space for storage. It was endlessly frustrating - things would fall through, it would sag and make it hard to slide things stored on the floor in and out, and generally it was just annoying. More recently we found other ways to make use of the joist space that are working out really well (see {numref}`garage-1`).
