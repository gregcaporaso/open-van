# Header mount points

## Overview

This document illustrates how I installed eye hooks in the header. We use this to mount [bungee netting](https://amzn.to/3qM9cbM) on the ceiling. Over our bed we partially lay out [wool army blankets](https://amzn.to/3bJqiT7) ({numref}`netting-1`). In our opinion you should have one of these on hand per-person as extra bedding in case of emergency, and they make a great layer on top of the netting because we can store light-weight packing cubes on top of them. Over the living area we store our window covers flat {numref}`netting-2`. This system works well as long as you don't store anything too heavy in the netting (otherwise it sags too much).

Eye hooks in the header allow for mounting or hanging all kinds of stuff (but nothing _too_ heavy). {numref}`interior-1` shows this in more context.

Bungee netting lets us store our window covers flat against the ceiling over the living area in addition to light-weight personal items over our bed.

## Installation

In the photos below, I show this using a scrap piece of header (a cutout from where I installed a dimmer switch). This took a little head scratching to come up with, but the idea is that I make a "header sandwich" using an [eye hook](https://amzn.to/3qMDURS), two [one-inch OD washers](https://amzn.to/2Q36WAf), and a [plastic drywall anchor](https://amzn.to/3cvCXs1). I had all of these parts on-hand already - those links show roughly what I used from what I can tell. I don't know how much weight each of these holds, but they feel pretty darn sturdy.

**The approach I took can only be applied while you have access to both sides of the header. So if you have it off to install insulation, lighting, etc., that's the time to install these.** Before taking the header off, I marked exactly where I wanted all of the mount points with little bits of [painters tape](https://amzn.to/3tctiNK). (I use painter's tape constantly, because it doesn't leave a sticky residue behind.) Once the header is off, orientation/etc can get confusing so I planned where everything went while it was still up. 

It's easier to explain with photos, so here goes...

The parts, in order of how they'll be assembled.
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-2.jpeg
---
name: header-mount-2
---
Drill a small hole where you want the mount point. I'm guessing this photo probabaly isn't needed, but oh well ... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-3.jpeg

---
Assemble the eye hook side. 
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-4.jpeg
---
name: header-mount-4
---
Assemble the wall anchor side (washer goes on first, then wall anchor).
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-5.jpeg
---
name: header-mount-5
---
Get a good grip on the wall anchor, but make sure that you're not going to restrict it from opening. The wall anchor will open perpendicular to the slice through it. 
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-6.jpeg
---
name: header-mount-6
---
Screw the eye hook into the wall anchor while holding the anchor in place. You want to make this pretty tight. In this photo I had already turned it a few times - notice how the header is getting deformed from the pressure. I gave the wall anchor a few more turns after this as well. 
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-7.jpeg
---
name: header-mount-7
---
As you're doing this, the wall anchor will open up. Adjust your grip on it as needed to allow it to open. Notice how the plastic anchor is longer than the screw - I think this is good to prevent the screw from scratching anything after it's installed. 
```

```{figure} images/header/mount-8.jpeg
---
name: header-mount-8
---
The finished "header sandwich". Notice how deformed the header is here. I feel like (within reason) the tighter the better so it can support more weight. 
```

That's it! Repeat for all of your mount points.

## Other ideas

This whole thing could also be achieved using eye bolts on machine screws with nuts on both sides. I experimented with that as well and it worked great, but I tend to use what I have around the shop and I had more of the parts illustrated here so I went with that approach. 

I'm considering swapping the bungee netting with nylon webbing (or something else that wouldn't sag under the weight) at some point. But again, I had the bungee net on-hand already, so I started with that. It's working pretty well so far.
