## Insulation

This document illustrates how I installed eye hooks (of two different sizes) in the ceiling of the van. We use the big ones to mount [bungee netting](https://amzn.to/3qM9cbM) on the ceiling and to hold the headliner in place (in place of the plastic plugs that initially held it). We use the little ones to hold light things - they're handy, but not mission critical by any means.

## Large eye hooks

Over our bed we store our window covers flat, as well as little things we want access to at might (e.g., glasses). This system works well as long as you don't store anything too heavy in the netting (otherwise it sags too much). Ultimately I might try nylon webbing, or something that won't stretch and sag quite as much, but for now it's working well.

The anchor points for the bungee netting are rivnuts that are installed where the plastic plugs that held the headliner in place were. There are eight of these total holding the headliner up, and even though I only use the back four for the bungee netting, installing rivnuts, big washers, and eye hooks is great for holding the headliner up, and eye hooks never hurt to have around for hanging things. Since they're mounted into the body of the van, they're really sturdy.

## Small eye hooks (good for really light stuff)

To have a place to hang little stuff (like van keys), I installed small eye hooks around the headliner. I did this by making a "headliner sandwich" using an eye hook, two one-inch OD washers, and a plastic drywall anchor. I don't know how much weight each of these holds, but they feel pretty darn sturdy.

The approach I took can only be applied while you have access to both sides of the headliner. So if you have it off to install insulation, lighting, etc., that's the time to install these. Before taking the headliner off, I marked exactly where I wanted all of the mount points with little bits of painters tape (which doesn't leave a sticky residue behind). Once the headliner is off, orientation/etc can get confusing so I planned where everything went while it was still up.

It's easier to explain with photos, so here goes...
