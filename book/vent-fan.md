# Vent fan

We installed a single Maxxair 00-06200K MaxxFan Ventilation Fan as far back as possible in our van. This page includes some photos illustrating the project.

Installing the vent fan was the part of the project I was least looking forward to. It's intimidating, but very doable. [FarOutRide's guide to this was indispensable for me](https://faroutride.com/fan-installation/). That's what I recommend referring to for this. I'm adding some photos of my work to show how I did this while. One difference between what I did and the FarOutRide build is that my goal was to retain the factory headliner, ducting, and curtain airbags.

## Disassembly of the factory headliner

I recommend Christopher Lum's video, [Ford Transit Headliner Removal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHj7PQ4SD3w) to learn how to take the factory headliner down. This is the first step. 

[This trim removal kit](https://amzn.to/3mfrUHW) was an essential set of tools for me throughout my project for working with the plastic hardware of the trim and headliner.

## Placement

I bought a vent adapter roof kit and inside support strips from [Impact Products](https://www.ebay.com/usr/impactproducts) on eBay. The parts all fit perfectly, and their customer service was great. They sell parts for different vehicle makes and models in their eBay store, so head there to figure out exactly what you need. 

I placed my vent van as far back in the van as I could. It fits perfectly in the "rear bay" of the ceiling on the 148" wheel base.

```

I first taped out the region where I would make my cut. Then, I drilled holes in the four corners. When doing this, I drilled the pilot holes from the inside of the van, and then cut the hole for the fan from the outside.

On the outside of the van, I aligned the roof adapter with the four holes that I drilled.

```

I traced the inside of the adapter with a Sharpie to make my guidelines for cutting. I then removed the roof adapter and cut the hole where I had traced with a jigsaw. Unfortunately I don't have a picture of this before cutting.

The blue `X`s indicate where the pilot holes came up. Those holes allowed me to align the roof adapter where I needed it, and then trace the inside with a Sharpie.

For better or worse, there is now a 14"x14" hole in the roof of my shiny, new-to-me vehicle. You can see that I went a little outside where I needed to cut with my pilot holes. That doesn't seem to have been an issue at all.
```

## Headliner preparation

At this point I measured where I would cut the headliner for the vent. I did this by putting the fan base in the hole, then putting the headliner back on temporarily, and tracing where I needed the hole from the roof of the van. I decided that I would have a much higher chance of cutting the hole in the right place this way than if I somehow tried to measure where the hole should be cut.

```

I then took the headliner back out, and cut the square in the headliner. The square intersects where the rear-most light was in the van headliner, so I just removed that light. I ultimately make a little patch from the scrap headliner that resulted from cutting the hole for the fan.

## Installation of roof adapter and support strips.

Trigger clamps work great for this (and a million other projects). I use mine constantly.

I called it a day at this point, and let everything dry overnight. ðŸŒ™

## Installing the vent fan

At this point, the hard work is done. Install the vent fan (again, refer to [FarOutRide's guide](https://faroutride.com/fan-installation/)).
