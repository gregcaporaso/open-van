Open Van

A photo journal of my camper conversion of a 2019 Ford Transit 350 15 Passenger XLT mid-roof.

We recently finished[^footnote1] doing a minimal[^footnote2] van conversion that allows us to keep curtain airbags throughout the van. We travel as a family of three, and sometimes as a family of two. Our build allows us to install one two-person bench seat in the back when we need it...

... and to take the bench seat out and have a more spacious "living room" when we don't need it.

This site is mostly a photo journal of the features of our van, with a few chapters that go into detail on how parts of it were built (like the [electrical system](./gz-electrical.md) and the [bed](./bed.md)). I'm not a professional van builder (by any means) so some things were done inefficiently, and some things I would do differently if I started over. But all-in-all, this was a great pandemic project, I learned a ton, and we're now having a lot of fun using the van on our [adventures](./adventures.md).

[^footnote1]: No camper van conversion is ever finished, as far as I can tell.

[^footnote2]: What started out as an idea to do a "minimal" camper van conversion turned out to be _a lot_ of work: about 18 months of weekends. About 85% of it was interesting and fun, and 15% of it was misery.
