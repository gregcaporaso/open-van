We recently finished[^footnote1] doing a minimal[^footnote2] van conversion that allows us to keep curtain airbags throughout the van. We sometimes travel as a family of three, and sometimes as a family of two. Our build allows us to install a two-person or three-person bench seat in the back when we need it:

```{figure} images/interior-5.jpeg

Van "living room" with the two-person bench seat installed. This fits where the original three-person bench was and we can alternatively install the three person bench here.
```

And we can take the bench seat out and have a more spacious "living room" when we don't need it:

Van "living room" without a bench seat installed and the driver and passnger seats swiveled to face the rear of the vehicle.

The bed comfortably sleeps two (luckily neither of us are very tall).

This site is mostly a photo journal of the features of our van, with a few chapters that go into detail on how parts of it were built (like the [electrical system](./gz-electrical.md) and the [bed](./bed.md)). I'm not a professional van builder (by any means) so some things were done inefficiently, and some things I would do differently if I started over. But all-in-all, this was a great pandemic project, I learned a ton, and we're now having a lot of fun using the van on our [adventures](./adventures.md).

[^footnote1]: No camper van conversion is ever finished, as far as I can tell.

[^footnote2]: What started out as an idea to do a "minimal" camper van conversion turned out to be _a lot_ of work: about 18 months of weekends. About 85% of it was interesting and fun, and 15% of it was misery.
