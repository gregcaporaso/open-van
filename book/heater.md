# Secondary heater

This Webasto heater connects to the vehicle's gas tank, so there is no extra fuel to carry. This is incredibly convenient.

Working on the vehicle's gas tank and installing a device that produces carbon monoxide is a bit out of my comfort zone. This is the one van project that I hired out, and it was money well spent.
